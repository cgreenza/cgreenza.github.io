Hi

I'm Chris Green, a software developer at [Digital Matter](https://www.digitalmatter.co.za). With this blog I’m hoping to share some interesting snippets of what I’m working on and playing with. The topics will generally be focussed on software development, electronics and information technology. I hope you find something useful here!

Happy browsing!
